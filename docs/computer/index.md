# What is a CPU?

The CPU, or Central Processing Unit, is the brain of a computer. 

The CPU is responsible for executing instructions that make up your computer programs. When you open a file, launch an application, or perform any action on your computer, the CPU is the component that performs the necessary calculations and operations to complete the task.

# What is RAM?

The RAM, or Random Access Memory, is the short-term memory of a computer. It is very fast, with access times in the order of nanoseconds, but its capacity is limited and volatile (it loses its contents when the power is switched off).

There is also RAM in the CPU, which is called a cache. They are SRAM (Static RAM)

The RAM sticks you see are DRAM (Dynamic RAM). They are slower than SRAM, but they are cheaper and have a larger capacity.

# What is ROM?

The ROM, or Read Only Memory, is the long-term memory of a computer. It is slower than RAM, but it is non-volatile (it retains its contents even when the power is switched off).

A Hard Drive or SSD is a type of ROM.

The iconic floppy disk is one of the early types of ROM.

# What is a GPU?

The GPU, or Graphics Processing Unit, is the component that processes graphics. It is responsible for rendering images on the screen.

All CPUs can process graphics, but GPUs are optimized for this task. They have a lot of cores and are very fast.

A CPU can do what a GPU does, but a GPU can't do what a CPU does.

# What is a PSU?

The PSU, or Power Supply Unit, is the component that supplies power to the computer. It converts the AC power from the wall into DC power for the computer.

The PSU is also responsible for regulating the voltage and current supplied to the computer.

On your phone, the PSU is the battery. And the BMU, or Battery Management Unit, handles the voltage and current regulation.

# What is a Motherboard?

The motherboard is the main circuit board of a computer. It is responsible for connecting all the components of the computer together.

The motherboard is also responsible for regulating the voltage and current supplied to the computer. High end motherboards have a lot of features, such as overclocking, RGB, and more. They also prevent components from damaging each other.

# You now joined the glorious PCMR

A computer is by design very modular. You can replace any component with another one, as long as it is compatible with the motherboard. Unleased the power of a PC!
